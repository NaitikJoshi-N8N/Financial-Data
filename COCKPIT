You are tasked with designing a high-end personal trading system for one user, intended as a real-time, fully interactive FX (or multi-asset) trading cockpit. The system should be capable of executing trades via any broker API the user provides, and it must allow integration of a Python algorithm for automated strategy execution. Think of this as a hedge-fund-quality dashboard for a single trader, with live metrics, execution control, and decision support. Creativity, detail, and “dashboard bling” are essential.

Requirements / Features:

Live Trade Execution:

Ability to pick an asset, enter trade parameters, and submit orders via any broker API (documentation will be provided).

Python algorithm integration: allow the user to plug in a strategy that can execute trades automatically or semi-automatically.

Configurable rule sets: define stop-loss, take-profit, position limits, and alerts.

Metrics Dashboard:

Real-time P&L (gross, net, and brokerage-adjusted).

Real-time brokerage and fees per trade.

Current positions and open orders.

Historical trade summary with visual analytics.

Risk metrics: exposure per asset, portfolio volatility, max drawdown, VaR-like indicators.

Customizable charts: candlesticks, order overlays, profit heatmaps, P&L waterfalls, liquidity visualization.

Alerts & Notifications:

Configurable warnings for account thresholds (e.g., % drawdown, open positions exceeding risk limits).

Trade execution confirmations, broker errors, and system notifications.

Fund / Balance Integration:

Display active balance, allocated capital per strategy, and cash available.

Track multiple fund allocations if required.

Strategy Sandbox & Simulation:

Paper trading mode to test strategies without risking real money.

Backtesting on historical FX data with visual overlays showing trade decisions vs. market movement.

Interactive Visualizations:

Real-time price feeds with depth of market / liquidity visualization.

Portfolio dashboard with drag-and-drop asset allocation adjustments.

Heatmaps showing performance by asset, time, or strategy.

Mini dashboards for each running strategy showing signals, trades, and performance.

User Experience & UI:

Clean, modern design with light/dark mode.

Drag-and-drop layout for dashboard widgets.

Multiple “cockpit screens” for different views: strategy, P&L, order book, alerts, risk metrics.

Creative Extras / Gold Features:

Trade simulation playback (rewind live trades to review decisions).

Broker comparison panel (for multiple APIs if connected).

Market sentiment integration (news tickers, FX sentiment indexes, optional NLP feeds).

Trade tagging and note-taking per position.

Auto-generated strategy performance reports (PDF/email).

Widget for “what-if” scenario testing: simulate moving SL/TP, leverage adjustments, or hypothetical trades.

Backend & Architecture Suggestions:

Strategy runtime sandboxed in Python containers.

Real-time data pipeline with WebSockets / REST APIs.

High-performance state management for positions and P&L (Redis or similar).

Database to store historical trades, performance metrics, and strategy logs.

Modular design: easy to swap broker API connectors or add new strategy modules.

Security & Reliability:

Authentication and authorization for user access.

Basic exception handling and fail-safes for trade execution errors.

Logging of all trades and strategy decisions.

Deliverables OPUS must produce:

Detailed architecture diagram, showing backend, data flow, strategy execution, broker integration, and dashboard layers.

Component-level responsibilities, including strategy runtime, order execution, risk engine, P&L computation, and dashboard rendering.

Workflow for trade execution, rule enforcement, Python strategy integration, and real-time metrics.

Front-end dashboard layout, with widget suggestions, chart types, alerts panels, and customization options.

Technology stack recommendation for max performance, flexibility, and single-user scalability.

Optional creative suggestions for “hedge-fund-level” features to make the system visually impressive and functional.

Tone: Creative, professional, and high-end; design this system as if it’s for a single trader with all the bells and whistles a fund manager would expect.
